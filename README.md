# ðŸ§  AI System for Diabetic Retinopathy Detection

This project is a deep learning-powered web application that detects Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) from retinal fundus images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and transfer learning. It features a Flask-based interface for real-time image upload and prediction.

> ðŸš€ **Upload a retinal image â†’ Get the DR stage predicted instantly!**

## ðŸ“Š Prediction Classes

The model classifies images into the following stages:
- **No_DR** â€“ No signs of diabetic retinopathy
- **Mild** â€“ Early stage
- **Moderate** â€“ Moderate damage
- **Severe** â€“ Advanced signs
- **Proliferate_DR** â€“ Critical condition
